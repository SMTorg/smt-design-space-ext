# SMT Design Space Extension 🌳

**Enhancing SMT with Hierarchical & Conditional Design Spaces**

This package is an extension to the SMT (Surrogate Modeling Toolbox), offering a powerful framework to define and manage **hierarchical**, **mixed-type**, and **conditionally active** variables in design spaces.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- **Hierarchical variables**: Support for nested conditional variables (e.g., a rotor configuration branch that only activates when `use_rotor = yes`).
- **Mixed types**: Handles continuous, integer or categorical variables uniformly.
- **Conditional activation**: Meta-variables powerfully control lower-level variable activation based on context.
- **Graph-based design space representation**: Clean and intuitive implementation of complex, branching designs.
- **Extensible subtress**: Easily add new types or layers of conditional logic.

---

## 📖 Why It Matters

In many engineering and simulation contexts, the design parameters form a structured, dependent hierarchy—optimizing them without a formal framework can lead to errors or inefficient models. This extension provides:

- A **formal representation** of hierarchical dependencies.
- Seamless integration with surrogate modeling tools and optimization routines.
- A foundation for improved experimental design and architectural exploration.

pip install smt-design-space-ext
```
https://pypi.org/project/smt-design-space-ext/

Requirements. See [Requirements](requirements.txt) for details.

## 🚀 Quick Start Example

```python
from smt_design_space_ext import (
    HAS_CONFIG_SPACE,
    HAS_ADSG,
    AdsgDesignSpaceImpl,
    ConfigSpaceDesignSpaceImpl,
    BaseDesignSpace,
    CategoricalVariable,
    FloatVariable,
    IntegerVariable,
    OrdinalVariable,
)

 ds = ConfigSpaceDesignSpaceImpl(
            [
                CategoricalVariable(["A", "B", "C"]),  # x0
                CategoricalVariable(["E", "F"]),  # x1
                IntegerVariable(0, 1),  # x2
                FloatVariable(0.1, 1),  # x3
            ],
            random_state=42,
        )
        ds.declare_decreed_var(
            decreed_var=3, meta_var=0, meta_value="A"
        )  # Activate x3 if x0 == A


```

This dynamically builds a tree-like structure of variables, enabling clear and constrained space exploration.
